<Header>Call an API</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to call an API in our test with <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank">axios</a>.

<SubHeader>Use Axios</SubHeader>

QA Wolf gives you access to the <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank">axios</a> library, which allows you to make <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods" target="_blank">HTTP requests</a>.

For example, let's say we are testing the sign up flow for QA Wolf. When you sign up with email, you need to enter a login code that we send to your email address.

To test sign up on QA Wolf, we use a service called <a href="https://testmail.app/" target="_blank">testmail.app</a> that gives us access to a test email inbox. We can call their API to read the email with the login code.

In our test, we add the following code. Note the call to `axios.get`, which makes a `GET` request to the testmail.app API:

```js
// get code from email
const { data } = await axios.get("https://api.testmail.app/api/json", {
  params: {
    apikey: process.env.TESTMAIL_API_KEY,
    namespace: "namespace",
    livequery: true,
    pretty: true,
    tag,
  },
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
});
```

If we log the response `data` to the console, it looks like this. Our test can now enter the code from the email subject:

```js
{
  emails: [
    {
      subject: "üê∫ QA Wolf code: ABC-DEF",
      // ...
    },
  ];
}
```

You can also make other types of requests with axios. For example, here is a `POST` request that creates a new user:

```js
await axios.post(
  "https://myapi.com/users/new",
  {
    email: "new@user.com",
    name: "New User",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      authorization: "Bearer token",
      "content-type": "application/json",
    },
  }
);
```
