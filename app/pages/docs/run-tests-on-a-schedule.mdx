<Header>Run Tests on a Schedule</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll schedule our tests to run every day. This helps ensure our critical workflows are not broken.

<SubHeader>Create Schedule Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="every day" />

Confirm you are on the "Schedule" tab.

<Image
  alt="Create trigger"
  height={458}
  src="/docs/run-tests-on-a-schedule/create-trigger.png"
  width={488}
/>

You can rename your trigger, or keep the default name ("Daily" in our example).

Next choose whether you want your tests to run every day or every hour. If you have created <Link href="use-environment-variables">environments</Link>, you will also need to select one for your trigger.

Once you are done, click the "Create trigger" button to save your trigger.

<SubHeader>Assign Schedule Trigger to Test</SubHeader>

<AssignTrigger doc="run-tests-on-a-schedule" />

<ViewRunHistory description="every day" />

</Layout>
