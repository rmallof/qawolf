<Header>Manage Alerts</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to manage alerts. QA Wolf alerts your team whenever your tests run, providing details about how many tests passed or failed.

You can choose to alert your team with <ExternalLink href="https://www.slack.com">Slack</ExternalLink> or email whenever your tests run.

<SubHeader>Update Alert Settings</SubHeader>

To update your alert settings, first visit the <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/settings">Team settings page</ExternalLink>. You can access this page from sidebar of the dashboard.

The alert settings are at the bottom of the settings page. By default, your team will receive email alerts every time your tests run.

The first setting is when your team receives alerts. If "Only on failure" is selected, you will receive an alert only when tests fail. If "Always" is selected, you will receive an alert every time your tests run (even if all tests pass).

<SubHeader>Add a Slack Channel</SubHeader>

To receive Slack alerts, you first need to add a Slack channel. Click the "Add Slack channel" button under "Alerts channel" to start this process.

Select the channel to post the alerts to and click "Allow".

You will be redirected to the settings page. Make sure your desired channel is now selected.

<SubHeader>Conclusion</SubHeader>

When your tests run, you will receive alerts in your selected channel (email or Slack).

The alerts will link to any failing tests with a video, logs, and the status of each line of code.
