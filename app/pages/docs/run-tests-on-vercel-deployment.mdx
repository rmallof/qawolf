<Header>Run Tests on Vercel Deployment</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll set up our tests to run when <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments" target="_blank">deploys</a> our site. This helps ensure our critical workflows don't break when we make changes.

### Choose Deployment Type

Vercel has <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#deployment-types" target="\_blank">two types of deployments</a>: **production** and **preview**. Production deployments happen when you merge to your production branch or run the `vercel --prod` command. Preview deployments are all other deployments, like deployments of commits in a GitHub pull request.

QA Wolf allows you to run your tests on all deployments (preview and production), just preview deployments, or just production deployments. Choose which deployments you want to test in the popup. In our example, we choose to only test preview deployments.

### Choose Branches (Optional)

You can also optionally specify which GitHub branches your tests should run on.

For example, at QA Wolf we have a group of tests that we run when staging is deployed. We deploy to staging automatically when we merge to the `develop` branch.

If you only want your tests to run on specific GitHub branches, choose "Select" under the GitHub branches option. You will be prompted to list these branches in an input. Enter a comma-separated list of branches like `develop,main`.

<SubHeader>Update Tests to Use Deployment URL</SubHeader>

Because our Vercel deployment URL isn't known in advance, QA Wolf passes it as an <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment variable</Link> (`process.env.URL`) when a deployment succeeds.

We need to update our tests to use this environment variable when specified.

Replace the URL in your tests with `process.env.URL`. For example, let's say our test currently starts with:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto("https://default.vercel.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

Let's update the `page.goto` call to go to `process.env.URL` if it exists, and our default URL otherwise:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
// go to process.env.URL if specified, and the default URL otherwise
await page.goto(process.env.URL || "https://default.vercel.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

Now when you make a pull request on GitHub, your tests will run after your Vercel deployment succeeds.
