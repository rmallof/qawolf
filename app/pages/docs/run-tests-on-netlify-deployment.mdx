<Header>Run Tests on Netlify Deployment</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll set up our tests to run on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> deployments. This helps ensure our critical workflows don't break when we make changes.

QA Wolf maintains a <ExternalLink href="https://app.netlify.com/plugins/netlify-plugin-qawolf/install">Netlify Build Plugin</ExternalLink> that runs your tests on <ExternalLink href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify">deploy previews</ExternalLink> or production deployments. If you have a different workflow, please <ExternalLink href="https://slack.qawolf.com">reach out for help</ExternalLink>.

<SubHeader>Create Deployment Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="on Netlify deployments" />

Select the "Deployment" tab in the middle, and choose Netlify as your deploy service.
You can also optionally rename your trigger.

<SubHeader>Install QA Wolf Build Plugin</SubHeader>

The next part of the modal provides one-time set up instructions for integrating QA Wolf with your Netlify project. If you have already completed these steps, you can skip this section.

First we need to install the QA Wolf Build Plugin. There are two ways to do this: from the <ExternalLink href="https://app.netlify.com/plugins/netlify-plugin-qawolf/install">Netlify UI</ExternalLink> (recommended) or with <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</ExternalLink>.

### A. Install from the Netlify UI (Recommended)

Click <ExternalLink href="https://app.netlify.com/plugins/netlify-plugin-qawolf/install">
this link to install the QA Wolf Build Plugin</ExternalLink>. You will be redirected to Netlify and asked to choose your site.

<Image
  alt="Install plugin"
  height={437}
  src={`/docs/run-tests-on-netlify-deployment/install-plugin.png`}
  width={704}
/>

You can also find the QA Wolf Build Plugin listed in the <ExternalLink href="https://app.netlify.com/plugins">Netlify Plugins directory</ExternalLink>.

### B. Install with npm

You can also use <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</ExternalLink> to install the QA Wolf Build Plugin.

Run the following command in your repository to install the plugin as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev netlify-plugin-qawolf
```

Then update the list of plugins in your `netlify.toml` file to include the QA Wolf plugin:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  # runs QA Wolf tests against the deployed URL
  package = "netlify-plugin-qawolf"
```

<SubHeader>Set QAWOLF_API_KEY Environment Variable in Netlify</SubHeader>

The other one-time step we need to do is to set the `QAWOLF_API_KEY` environment variable in Netlify. This variable identifies your QA Wolf team in the Netlify Build Plugin.

If you have already done this, you can skip this section. Otherwise, follow <ExternalLink href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables">these instructions</ExternalLink> to create an environment variable in Netlify.

Specifically, create an environment variable named `QAWOLF_API_KEY` with the value provided in the modal.

<Image

  width={485}

<Image
  alt="Netlify set environment variable"
  height={695}
  src={`/docs/run-tests-on-netlify-deployment/set-environment-variable.png`}
  width={1600}
/>

<SubHeader>Choose Deploy Context</SubHeader>

QA Wolf supports running tests on two Netlify <ExternalLink href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#deploy-contexts">deploy contexts</ExternalLink>: `deploy-preview` and `production`.

Production deployments happen when you deploy to your production branch (example: `main`). Preview deployments correspond to the preview URLs for pull requests.

QA Wolf allows you to run your tests on all deployments (preview and production), just preview deployments, or just production deployments. Choose which deployments you want to test in the popup. In our example, we choose to only test preview deployments.

<SubHeader>Optional: Install GitHub App</SubHeader>

<InstallGitHubApp service="netlify" />

<ChooseEnvironment />

<SubHeader>Assign Deployment Trigger to Test</SubHeader>

<AssignTrigger doc="run-tests-on-netlify-deployment" />

<SubHeader>Update Tests to Use URL from Netlify</SubHeader>

Because a Netlify deployment URL isn't known in advance, QA Wolf passes it as an <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment variable</Link> (`process.env.URL`) when the deployment succeeds.

We need to update our tests to use this environment variable when specified.

Replace the URL in your tests with `process.env.URL`. For example, let's say our test currently starts with:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto("https://default.netlify.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

Let's update the `page.goto` call to go to `process.env.URL` if it exists, and our default URL otherwise:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
// go to process.env.URL if specified, and the default URL otherwise
await page.goto(process.env.URL || "https://default.netlify.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

If you <Link href="#optional-install-git-hub-app">installed the QA Wolf GitHub app</Link>, you will be able to see QA Wolf status checks in GitHub.
