<Header>Run Tests with API</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll trigger our tests by calling the QA Wolf API.

<SubHeader>Create API Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="when we call the QA Wolf API" />

Select the "API" tab on the right.

<Image
  alt="Create trigger"
  height={418}
  src="/docs/run-tests-with-api/create-trigger.png"
  width={486}
/>

You can rename your trigger, or keep the default name ("API" in our example). If you have created <Link href="use-environment-variables">environments</Link>, you will also need to select one for your trigger.

  src="/docs/run-tests-with-api/choose-environment.png"
  width={486}
/>

You'll notice a gray box that provides an example of how to call the QA Wolf API. Copy this example as we'll use it later. Don't worry, you can always access it again by editing the trigger.

Once you are done, click the "Create trigger" button to save your trigger.

<SubHeader>Run Tests by Calling QA Wolf API</SubHeader>

Let's revisit the API call example we copied when we created our trigger. If you forgot to copy it, you can access it again by editing the trigger.

`curl -H "Authorization: qawolf_api_key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://www.qawolf.com/api/suites -d '{"env": { "MY_VARIABLE": "secret" }, "trigger_id": "xxxv8y6ii000008mocm506o3l"}'`

This API call makes a `POST` request to the `/suites` endpoint. It includes a few parts:

- The <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization">Authorization header</ExternalLink> provides your team's API key: `-H "Authorization: qawolf_api_key"`
- The `trigger_id` in the request body tells QA Wolf to run tests assigned to that trigger: `"trigger_id": "xxxv8y6ii000008mocm506o3l"`
- The optional `env` object in the request body passes additional environment variables to your tests: `"env": { "MY_VARIABLE": "secret" }`

If you paste this command into your terminal and run it, you'll get a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "suiteId",
  "url": "https://www.qawolf.com/suites/suiteId"
}
```

The `id` returned is the id of your new suite. The `url` links to the results page for your tests.

<SubHeader>Get Suite Details by Calling QA Wolf API</SubHeader>

If you want to check the status of your suite via API, you can make a `GET` request to the `/suites/:id` endpoint. This is useful if you want to take other actions after your suite finishes running.

Include your API key as an <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization">Authorization header</ExternalLink>, and the id of the suite in the URL (`suiteId` in the example below).

`curl -H "Authorization: qawolf_api_key" https://www.qawolf.com/api/suites/suiteId`

If you call this endpoint, the response will look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "suiteId",
  "is_complete": false,
  "runs": [
    {
      "id": "runId",
      "status": "created", // can also be 'fail' or 'pass'
      "test_name": "My Test"
    }
  ],
  "status": "created" // can also be 'fail' or 'pass'
}
```
