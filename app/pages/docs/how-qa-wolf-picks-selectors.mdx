<Header>How QA Wolf Picks Selectors</Header>

As you use your site, QA Wolf picks the best selector for each element (like a button or text input) that you interact with. This guide explores how QA Wolf chooses selectors.

<SubHeader>QA Wolf Selector Logic</SubHeader>

### Target Attributes

QA Wolf first tries to target elements with test attributes like `data-cy`, `data-e2e`, `data-qa`, `data-test`, or `data-testid`.

For example, if you click on a button with the following HTML:

```html
<button data-qa="submit">Submit</button>
```

QA Wolf will create test code targeting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors" target="_blank">CSS selector</a> `[data-qa="submit"]`:

```js
await page.click('[data-qa="submit"]');
```

When you run your test, Playwright will look for an element where the `data-qa` attribute is set to `submit`. If it cannot find an element where `data-qa` equals `submit` before timing out, the test fails.

### Default Selector Logic

If the element does not have a test attribute like `data-qa`, QA Wolf falls back to its default selector logic.

In a nutshell, the default selector logic chooses the best available CSS or text selector for the target element. It prefers attributes like `id` over attributes like `href`. If there is not a matching selector for the target element alone, QA Wolf will try to find one that includes an ancestor.

The default selector logic checks that the selector does not match a different element. It also does its best to avoid using dynamic `class` and `id` attributes.

As a last resort, QA Wolf will target an element by its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath" target="_blank">XPath</a>.

<SubHeader>Selector Best Practices</SubHeader>

A best practice in testing is to use test attributes like `data-qa` or `data-test` in your front end code. These selectors make your tests more robust to changes in your application code.

If possible, you should consider updating your front end code to include test attributes. Don't worry - you don't need to do this all at once. If a test attribute is not included for a test step, QA Wolf will fall back to the <Link href="#qa-wolf-selector-logic"><a>default selector logic</a></Link>.

For example, let's say we have a submit button with the following HTML:

```html
<button>Submit</button>
```

To explicity label our element for use in testing, we'll add a `data-qa` attribute with the value of `submit`:

```html
<button data-qa="submit">Submit</button>
```

Now even as the text, CSS classes, and other attributes of our submit button change, the `data-qa` attribute will always label it as the `submit` element to use in tests.
