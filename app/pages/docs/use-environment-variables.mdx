<Header>Use Environment Variables</Header>

Environment variables are secret values that you can use in your test code. Because they are encrypted, they are useful for storing sensitive values like passwords.

Environment variables can also be used to change the behavior of your test by group. For example, you may want to write a test that goes to one URL for staging and a different URL for production.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how use environment variables in our tests.

<SubHeader>Create an Environment</SubHeader>

Environments are groups of environment variables. You can create, rename, and delete environments from the test editor and from the dashboard.

Let's create an environment if you don't have one already. In our example, we'll create an environment called "Staging".

Open the environments popup by clicking the "Environments" button in the sidebar of the dashboard, or the configure button in the bottom left corner of the test editor.

/>

<Image
  alt="Edit environments from test editor"
  height={758}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/edit-environments-editor.png"
  width={1600}
/>

Create an environment by clicking the "Create environment" button on the left side of the popup.

<Image

  height={384}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/create-environment.png"
  width={800}
/>

Type the environment name in the input and press enter to save your environment.

<Image

  height={110}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/save-environment.png"
  width={206}
/>

You can rename and delete environments by hovering over them and clicking the options button.

<SubHeader>Create an Environment Variable</SubHeader>

Now that we have an environment, let's add some variables to it.

Click the "Create variable" button in the right side of the environments popup to create a variable.

<Image
  alt="Create environment variable"
  height={385}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/create-environment-variable.png"
  width={800}
/>

Enter the variable name and value into the form. We'll name our varaiable `TODO_TEXT` and give it a value of `secret todo`. Click "Save" to save your variable.

<Image
  alt="Save environment variable"
  height={434}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/save-environment-variable.png"
  width={800}
/>

Your variable will be encrypted and saved. You can edit and delete environment variables by hovering over them and clicking the relevant button.

<Image
  alt="Edit environment variable"
  height={284}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/edit-environment-variable.png"
  width={800}
/>

Click "Done" to close the popup.

<SubHeader>Use an Environment Variable</SubHeader>

We can now use our `TODO_TEXT` environment variable in our test. Environment variables are accessible under `process.env`.

First, open your test in the editor. Make sure your desired environment is selected in the bottom left corner of the test editor.

<Image
  alt="Choose environment in editor"
  height={753}
  src="/docs/use-environment-variables/choose-environment.png"
  width={1600}
/>

In our example, we'll replace a hard-coded todo value with the value saved as `TODO_TEXT` (`secret todo`). We'll change this line of code:

```js
await page.fill('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', "todo");
```

To this line of code:

```js
await page.fill(
  '[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]',
  process.env.TODO_TEXT
);
```

In the code editor, we can delete the existing todo value (`"todo"`) and replace it with `process.env.TODO_TEXT`. You'll notice as you type `process.env.` that your environment variables will be shown as suggestions.

/>

If we run our test, it will now create a todo with the value `secret todo`, which comes from our environment variable.

<SubHeader>Assign Environment to Trigger</SubHeader>

Environments can be assigned to <Link href="/docs/run-tests-on-a-schedule"><a>triggers</a></Link> in QA Wolf. This means that when tests runs are created by the trigger, they will have access to the variables in the assigned environment.

To add an environment to a trigger, open the triggers popup.

<Image

  height={353}
  src="/docs/run-tests-on-a-schedule/add-trigger-dashboard.png"
  width={1600}
/>

Edit the trigger so that your desired environment is selected.
